# Chipin
Project Plan
Chipin is a service that provides volunteer networking and validation for community service.
1.WE will use passport.js to implement our user account functionality. This will include creating appropriate React views for handling oncomers to the site. This will include a sign in / log in form before you get to yourr profile page.
2. your profile page will consist of a profile header containing your info. underneath are two daata feeds: one gives your saved events(which should be in a card giving its info) and the other has your created events(which includes the ability to delete events and to validate a persons hours).
3.the browse page brings a stack of events up to be browsed. these will have a card that will display static info at first, but with more dynamic functionality as we add features. at first these will be sorted by date. search and better sorts aare future features. You can save events as well.
